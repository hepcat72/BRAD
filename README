These scripts are components of an analysis which can be used to predict tRNA-Ligand binding, based on experimentally measured Kd binding rates.  Basically, oneByOneTrnaLigand.pl is a genetic algorithm that formulates an equation to fit the data in the known Kds of the input data table.  oneByOneCalculateKd.pl will take the equation's factors and a set of RNA loops and will output the predicted Kds of those loops.
